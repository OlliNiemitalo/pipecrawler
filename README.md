# pipecrawler
Crawler for helical scanning of pipes. Work in progress.

The idea is to build a robot that rotates inside the pipe and slowly moves along the pipe, on a helical track. Attaching a camera allows to image the pipe or to image whatever is outside a transparent pipe. Overlap of successive turns allows stitching the images or video together.

This was 3d-printed in PETG and the flexure springs feel a bit too tight.
